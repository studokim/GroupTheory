Small app helping to investigate basics of the group theory.

Written as a self-help with the Algebra course homework in the 3th semester.

## Features

For each given multiplicative or additive group, the following is possible:

- compute the order of an element
- build a subgroup by a given representative element
- test if the subgroup is normal

- compute the commutant
- build a factorgroup by a given subgroup
